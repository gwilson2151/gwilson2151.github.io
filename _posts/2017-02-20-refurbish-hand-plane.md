"Refurbish Your Hand Plane" seminar with Andy "The Plane Guy" Block at Lee Valley Coquitlam.
Looks like plane is pre-1900s. Actually used lots, rosewood handle, new iron (edgerite?), replaced frog & lever handle.
Broke down hand plane into:
- base
- frog
- lever cap
- plane iron cap
- plane iron
- handle
- knob
- screws

Removed surface rust on outside and sole of base with sandpaper (120 grit if I remember correctly).
Removed surface rust on top of base with steel wool & light machine oil.
Flattened sole with lapping plate, (some kind of) grit, water.
Had to scrape out some tar by handle on top of base, still some cleanup to do there.
Epoxied handle back together, need to scrape off excess with sharp chisel.
Ground bevel on plane iron and flattened back.
Sharpened plane iron.
Assembled & adjusted frog. Plane doesn't have frog adjustment screw so have to do manually. Tighten port side first to reduce frog twist.
Attached handle & knob.
Attached iron & lever cap.
Adjust & take shavings.
